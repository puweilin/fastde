# FastDE

This is an R package for performing differential gene expression analysis.   It is designed as a drop-in replacement for the Seurat FindAllMarkers function.

The goal of the library is to improve computational performance and large scale data handling.

Currently, Seurat supports 9 algorithms.   FastDE supports student's t-test and Wilcox Rank Sum test.
